### Introduction
what is cloud and why do we need the cloud?  
- Challenge:  
  + Peak usage during holidays and weekends    
  + Less load during rest of the time  
  + High cost of procuring infrastructure  
  + Needs ahead of time planning (Can you guess the future?)  
  + Low infrastructure utilization (PEAK LOAD provisioning)  
  + Dedicated infrastructure maintenance team (Can a startup afford it?)  

- Solution (before the Cloud):  
  + **PEAK LOAD provisioning** : Procure (Buy) infrastructure for peak load -> if this is the peak load, you expect you'd buy infrastructure to support that kind of a load.     

- How about provisioning (renting) resources when you want
them and releasing them back when you do not need them?
  + On-demand resource provisioning   
  + Also called Elasticity  
> This is also called on demand resource provisioning.
> If you have high load on your application, if you have a huge number of users using the application, And when the load goes down, once the number of users on your application goes down, you'll release the resources back to the cloud.

- Advantages
- Trade "capital expense" for "variable expense"
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
- Stop guessing capacity
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers "Go -
